Fruit Jam Light Tunnel

Bruce Blake ( @b-blake ) pointed out that the Adafruit Fruit Jam had a bit of light bleed between the built-in five LEDs and default cover plate. I put mocked up and printed a little 3D printed adapter to isolate the light from each LED to the cover plate. The 3mm heat insert and screw are optional for securing the fourth corner of the plate.
