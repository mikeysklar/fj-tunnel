Fruit Jam Light Tunnel

[@b-blake](https://github.com/b-blake) noticed that the [Adafruit Fruit Jam](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5900) had a bit of light bleed between the built-in LEDs and the default cover plate.  
I mocked up and printed a small 3D adapter to isolate the light from each LED to its own channel.  
The 3 mm heat-set insert and screw are optional, but help secure the fourth corner nicely.

Printed adapter installed â€” LEDs look much cleaner now!
